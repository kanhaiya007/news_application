# newsapplication
News Application built in Flutter with NewsApi.org.

## Getting Started
This project is a simple News Application built in Flutter. This project uses API from newsApi.org to fetch the data and display them.
This project is for sample purposes and can also contain some bugs. This application can help you with How to use API with Http Client, how to handle responses, and how to display the links in web view in Flutter. 

You just need to visit the api->NewsApiProvider and change the API key with your key and run the application.
Thanks!!
